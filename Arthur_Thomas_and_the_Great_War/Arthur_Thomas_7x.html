I have been asked to write you, by my chum Pte Cann, for he said you
would like to know about your son Arthur.&nbsp; Well I shall be
pleased to give you all I know, for me and your son were chums, and I
was with him just before his death, for we were sitting in the trench
together quite happy, for I was asking him how he came to get into B.
Company, for we were both in A. Company together last year, and I got
put into B. Company when I went back this year, and he was telling me
that he was going to take charge of the platoon for the attack only,
and of course we were talking about old times together, and about ten
minutes afterwards, he and another Sgt named Scarce got buried by a
shell, and Arthur got his neck broken and the other Sgt was badly
wounded, but I can assure you that he bore no pain, and I was very much
upset by his death, for we got on so well together, for we were on the
Somme together, for he was on the same gun as me and Cann, and he had
the misfortune to get wounded, but before he left the trench he shook
hands with us, and I am sure we will miss him very much, for he was so
brave and fearless, and I know he was well liked by the Company, and
will be missed by all.&nbsp; I shall be on leave shortly and shall
only be too pleased to pay you a call.&nbsp; Hoping this letter
will help you a bit, I also send my deepest sympathy for your great
loss.</font></font></p>
