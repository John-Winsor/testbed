Arthur Thomas Handley was born in June 1895 in West Ham, East
London.&nbsp; Subsequently the family moved to Ilford, Essex where
his father Arthur Handley opened a fish and poultry shop at 72 - 74
High Road, Ilford.&nbsp; The family lived above the shop.&nbsp;
At the time the Great War broke out in 1914 Arthur Thomas was
indentured as an apprentice to an engineering company in East London.</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="4">I
was told by my grandmother that Arthur had been deeply upset because he
was given a "white feather" by some young women at work.&nbsp; I
believe this symbolic act of cruelty was not uncommon in the social
climate of the time.&nbsp; Whether or not that was the motive,
Arthur resolved to join the army.&nbsp; But he was bound by his
Articles of Apprenticeship to remain at work.&nbsp; So in March
1915, aged nearly 20, he decided the issue by running away and
signing-up with the army.</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font size="4">
On the next page is displayed Arthur's first letter home.&nbsp; He is
obviously concerned about the political repercussions of his actions.</font></p>

                  <font size="4">There was a story that
Arthur was first sent to a training camp in north Essex after which he
was put on a train to Portsmouth for embarkation.&nbsp; When the
train was approaching Ilford station Arthur wrote his father a hasty
note and tied it to a penknife.&nbsp; As the train shot through the
station he threw it out of the window.&nbsp; The penknife with note
attached was retrieved from the platform and delivered to his
family.&nbsp; In consequence his parents journeyed to Portsmouth
and were briefly re-united with Arthur before he embarked.</font>

                  <p align="left"><font size="4">
Arthur served with the Royal Fusiliers on the Western Front in France
and Belgium.&nbsp; In July 1916 he survived the Battle of the Somme along
with only 11 others from his Company after being ordered to go "over
the top".&nbsp; It is a matter of sad record that Arthur was killed in
August 1917 by a German shell.&nbsp; This happened due to sporadic shelling
and was not part of any specific battle.&nbsp; He was then aged 22 years.&nbsp;
It is surprising, perhaps, that he survived as long as he did.</font></p>

                  <font size="4">Arthur's grave is in Hooge Crater Military
Cemetery, Belgium.&nbsp; This is on route N8 about 2&frac12; miles east of Ypres
town centre.&nbsp; For those who would visit, Arthur's grave is first in row 6H.</font>

In consequence of the Great War there was terrible grief throughout the land.&nbsp;
This encouraged the cult of spiritualism as distraught parents sought to contact
their dead sons.&nbsp; In this sad climate my grandmother attended a spiritualist
meeting where she heard words spoken that caused her fear and distress.&nbsp;
She walked out of the meeting and never returned.&nbsp; I think the Handley family
were broken by Arthur's death and I am not sure they ever fully recovered.</font></p>
